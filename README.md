# ðŸ›« Air Traffic
**Real-time air traffic control**

This is my first Python notebook!  
To gain experience (and for fun ðŸ˜„), I built an API connection to visualize **real-time air traffic**.  
The project retrieves live flight data from the *OpenSky Network API*, showing aircraft positions on an **interactive map** and exploring the **relationship between speed and altitude** through a scatterplot.

More to come...
